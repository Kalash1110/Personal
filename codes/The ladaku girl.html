<h2 style="color:purple;font-size:50px;text-align:center;"> A Ladaku Girl</h2>
<p class="maroon" style="text-align:center;">**Here this content is divided in certain sections and proper image links are also provided.Please check them out**</p>
<p class="blue" style="text-align:left;">Hello people!,So now this page is talking to you about a girl who is very cute,a bit fat not that much though and she quarrles so much  that I can't explain.
Hope you enjoy the segment!!!</p>

	<div class="orange" style="font-size:175%;text-align:left;">SECTION 1: THE INCEPTION</div>

<p>Okay,So the story starts from this years's march you can say,when the all sort of issue of COVID-19 occured.I was 20 and we both were in our colleges.Both means me and my gilrfriend cum special friend and our colleges were in two of the big cities of India : Kolkata and Delhi. You guessed it right ,we were in not so long distance relationship.
	So all colleges were about to shut temporarily due to the day by day increase in infection due to the deadly virus and we,the students were advised to go to our respective homes.Now,the part to be happy was that she was my schoolmate and thus we both had home in the same city.So we both headed towards our destinations happily cause everyone wants to be home ultimately.
	life was quite a happening before lockdown.We both used to talk for 2-3 hours daily either chatting or voice calls and sometimes those cheesy video calls.I used to listen her morning voice daily after waking up and each day that voice seemed more attractive,more craving than before.Those special clicks that was only for me in which she pouted and it felt like we will kiss each other just after a second.

<div class="orange" style="font-size:175%;text-align:left;">SECTION 2: THE CONVENTIONAL LIFE</div>
<p>
Okay,Now coming from a bihari family its is obvious that your parents have a conservative mindset and the same principle was also applicable on me.Hence I can't talk to my girlfriend on phone calls and even she wasn't also allowed to do so and that is like "okay" because we both have to face those situtaions thrice or four times in a year when we used to go to our home during either semester breaks or puja breaks.But in those vacations we used to chat a lot.but this time it wasnt that simple.I was in 2nd year ,too close to go in 3rd year and that is the year when you decide the structure and future pathaway of your career and not only me, the same thing applied on her also.So lockdown started and we all were happy that atleast we do not have to give exams that soon and have some quality time sleeping and doing "my stuff" tagged work in home.But I never knew that things won't be that easy for me.We started having online classes and other academic stuffs and all was cool but the feeling I was missing,the extra sweet layer of life that I was missing, was "She".</p>




	<div class="orange" style="font-size:175%;text-align:left;">SECTION 3: THE REMINISCENCE</div>
<p>Ohh memories,you know your mind is like each time it wants to go into those deep sea of memories even though it knows that it can be painful,but sometimes it is so much satisfying to relive those special moments in your mind,it feels like that moment just happended,you were a part of that thing few minutes ago.The girl with whom i used to talk so much,tell her how my day went,what new stuff I did today.And to listen her long conversations in which she used to describe about a random teacher and random friend and I was never interested in her friends and teachers but the her flow and the effort she used to make in narrating those stories always made me having so much interest in listening to those stories.I missed all those lovely talks,those days beacuse now she used to talk too less,generally for half an hour a day.</p>

   <div class="orange" style="font-size:175%;text-align:left;">SECTION 4: THE CONCERN</div>
	<p>She had her reasons and that were quite valid,and the biggest reason was that she can't talk infront of her parents and that is quite undestandable now for me,not at that time unfortunately or fortunately,you can't let your parents think that my daughter is having a boyfriend which is damn cute ,hot smart and handsome.Yes I am,don't laugh now,atleast I think I am.In earlier vacations the trick that we used was to chat in night but this vacation was somewhat special,her dad asked her and her sister to leave their phones during their sleep time in his room.
Oops game starts.Like I still don't understand why her dad tells her to do so.Is dad having a keen eye on her and eehe thinks that her daughter has a boyfrined because once he caught me with her.Yes and that was very embarassing moments where I had no clue what to do.Funny Story that one.But though dads are always like this,even my dad does so.And no matter what I tell you these parents always think better for their kids, and that's why may be he thinks that she will use her phone in night and will not be able to wake up early in the morning and do her regular stuffs at time.Though whatever be the case we began to talk less than before and definitely not having old late night chats as before.</p>

<div class="orange" style="font-size:175%;text-align:left;">SECTION 5: THE TUSSLE</div>
<p>
Thus each night I use to miss her and each night she couldn't talk.Things went on for months.Two months later the situaton was so bad that each day I wanted to talk and she had no option other than to talk less and less, and then I used to blame her everytime for not talking.
Each day she used to listen this.Slowly slowly she began to loose calm, and also me,each day I used to get hurt that why she isn't talking  and this all is her fault and so on.We both had our own reasons and no one wanted to understand the situation of the other person.So she got frustated and that girl became "A GUSSAIL GIRL" which she usually is,she loses her temper very quickly and then also at the same time loses her anger more quickly and that is the best part of her.So days went on,things got bad day by day,issues rose,trust issues came,lot of negative conversationsa started going on and that girl who always is cute,sweet,less in height and a bit fat due to lockdown and no exercise,for my mind she became "A LADAKU GIRL",basically not,She isn't that ladaku,she tries to resolve issues in a better way than me but that situation became so unhealthy that she had to act like that.</p>

<div class="orange" style="font-size:175%;text-align:left;">SECTION 6: THE REBOUND</div>
<p>At the same time,for my academic improvement I started to have to think about doing a new course and that is a "HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT Course" which basically teaches you how to make and design websites.
Nearly at same time the fights were as usual and it was looking that the relationship is going in a wrong direction but then they both stopped a bit,thought a bit,discussed a bit,talked a bit with patience and that is the speciality of these two."They don't want to ruin any of their precious moments".I wish this statement stays longer that there shouln't come a chance where something bad happens, but for now,for tis moment,they both started a new chapter after taking a new lessson.
It is quite obvious they will definitely fight later also, but atleast for now they are happy,they are resurging.He is learning something new she is doing the same,and right now she is struggling with her phone which is not working.</p>

<p class="blue">So,The idea is pure,The idea is of happiness for her,idea is to make her feel special,idea is to make the first ever HTML code and a website page in which he writes something about her,idea is to practice developing web pages ,idea is to "study and miss her",idea is to make that girl not "A LADAKU GIRL" but making her the old as usual "A HAPPY AGILE GIRL".</p>
<div class="blue">Signing off your so called story buddy page,story buddy!!..actually this is not a story this is just a fun and web developing practice and a not so small message to her that how much I miss her.</div>

Is this same happens to me after 3yrs??... What if it's happened but their is no trace of our love, our relationship. It makes me feel guilty or something else that I can't explain in words. You're my 1st in every aspect how could I forget you, that's not easy for me to get out from you. The chilling winds reminds me of your returning from Delhi to Kolkata (airport scene:- where I'm crying and don't want to let you go. When you went into the airport I looked at the airport in hope you came over and hold my hand and hug me and I break into your arm. After you there is same chill wind at airport and tears in my eyes. I stepped out but in my mind there is only thoughts of your presence.). After your trip to Delhi only your warmth is with me. I'm missing your presence daily in my life then, how could I forget you so easily after few yrs.

The heart is in my mouth when m following you into the lobby.... that thought, what we having conversations, what we do, how I make a eye contact with you, what if you touch my hand, what if you come close to me...no idea at all...m really flush out at that moment... after having sheat I just looked at you and that very few seconds I really realize that I'm with you, with that guy I liked so deeply but never admire him as my boyfriend....at that time I felt their is destiny, if something is in your favor then it'll definitely comes to you...Then I suddenly felt that I'm making eye contact with you and I clench my fist....

It's really great to complete a year with u...Like hum th kv soche v nahi the k aisa din v aayega...when there will be anniversary type kuch v between us...It's is really special for me to complete a year with u...humko th laga v nahi k ek saal kb beet gya...aisa lgta h k do mahine pehle hi sb suru hua ho.. It's all because of ur chulbulapan... understanding abilities,ur sweet and cute gesture towards me...humko bother nahi krne Wala tmhara attitude...humko chidhana preshaan krna hasane Wala dosti Wala attitude Jo k bht hi jyada connect krta hai humlog ko ek dusre se..... 
Haan humdono bht Durr hai...infact bht hi jyada dur...saal Mei bs do baar dhang se milte h....ekdusre se Milne k liye pgalate...ek dusre ko dekhne k liye taraste hai....pr ye sb itna v bura nahi hai....Syd yahi SB cheej humlogo ko ek dusre ka value btata hai.... specially humko....ek din TM gussa rho ya hum gussa rhe...th it really affects me very much...like av ho rha h...dono ek dusre se gussa h...ik TM v chahti hogi k merese baat kro...n hum v yahi chahte...but pata nahi donk Kyu baat nahi KR rhe.....these days ladai v bht ho rha h... but it's all part..dono same to same nahi ho skte na... Definitely differences hoga hi...but inspite of having differences...having arguments....having different attitudes....agr hum dono ek dusre k sath h....ek dusre ko khus rkhne ka koshish krte h.... ek dusre k bare Mei sochte h...isse jyada Kya chahiye... 
I am really rookie in these things...but u were there to guide me...to tell me what is right n wrong....to help me deal with situations...to correct me when m wrong...to hold me when m afraid....to encourage me....to motivate me....to Be the closest person and friend that I ever have till my life.... 
Humko nahin pata first anniversary pr Kya krte h....lekin itna pata hai k tmko first anniversary pr gussa nahi dekh skte hum....lad nahi skte tmse aaj k din hum.... If I have done anything wrong m sorry....but bae Mera v expectations rhta hai na....Thora tnsn hai ajkl....hum v chahte Hain k TM gussao nahi bhale hum av gussa kre....kyunki m really stressed love.... bematlb ka hum v nahi ldna chahte but dimaag itna choked hai k sahi galat pata hi nahi chlta av.... emotions kuch hai hi nahi siwaye frustration k.... 
So..I guess the best gift for today k I apologise to u for all my galti that I have done in past one year...jitna baar v tmko rulaye ho...jitna baar v tmko bura feel krwaye ho...jitna baar v tmko hurt kiye ho...chahe wo metro station pe tmhara hath jhatak k...ya fir chat pr gussa k ya fir call pe chilla k....ya fir wo Sara chota mota galti jisse tmko ittu sa v bura laga ho.... Sri m not saying k m perfect but galti th hoga hi na bae... important ye hai k keeping all things aside I try to sudharo my galti...for u...for our relationship ....jruri nahi hai k hmesa hum hi sahi ho ya TM hi Sai ho....but kv kv sahi hoke v maafi mangne Mei burai nahi hai na... 
U don't know k TM kitta special hai mere liye...kitta qualities ginaye tmhara....TM hmesa khti k hum tareef nahi krte...but bae...u r perfect for me... tareef krke najar Kyu lgana...TM jaisi v hai...achi buri...choti bachi jaisi...sharp nose..cute dimples..blackish pink lips...small 
hands...mota pair...black dhaga.. beautiful fingers...sanp Wala til..shoulder Wala til...nosepin...earring...n tmhara pagal Wala hasi... 
SB kuch everything is perfect.... 
I love u girl.... always be with me whenever I need u or don't....hmesa bs mere sath raho...sukh dukh..din raat..duuur ya paas..ur presence always makes my life positive and cheerful...
